# ID3-QuickList
A lightweight MP3 file sorter for when you need to quickly insert a new track into a folder and automatically renumber all existing tracks in both filenames and ID3 metadata.
Good for managing large music collections without manually editing track numbers.

How to Use:

Select the MP3 folder.

Choose the MP3 file to insert.

Enter the track number and click Execute.

Note: Filenames must start with a two-digit number (e.g., 01 TrackName.mp3).
All other metadata is preserved.
