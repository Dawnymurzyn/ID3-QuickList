# ID3-QuickList

A lightweight MP3 file sorter for quickly inserting a new track into a folder and automatically renumbering all existing tracks in both filenames and ID3 metadata.  
Ideal for managing large music collections without manually editing track numbers.

## How to Use

1. Select the MP3 folder.
2. Choose the MP3 file to insert.
3. Enter the track number and click **Execute**.

**Note:**  
Filenames must start with a two-digit number (e.g., `01 TrackName.mp3`).  
This application only edits track numbering in ID3 metadata.  
All other metadata (title, artist, album, cover art) is preserved.
